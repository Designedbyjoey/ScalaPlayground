Project Goals
-------------
To build an enterprise service bus that facilitates the construction of large-scale distributed systems aligned with business needs.

Some important factors are:
	+ runs on linux primarily
	+ balance between ease of use and understanding how it works
	+ horizonatally scalable with cpu cores (or as close as possible)
	+ able to process messages fast if needed

Systems built with this need to be:
	+ fault tolerant - if part of the system fails, other should be fine
	+ resilient to loss of data once intention has been captured
	+ performant - the bus should not slow down applications, and should help as much as possible to make the application faster
	+ scalable
	+ monitored - how is the system coping with usage/load?


Major use-cases
---------------
1. Services can send commands that are handled by only 1 consumer
2. Events can be published handled by multiple subscribers
3. Sagas 

Questions
----------
1. How do other service buses work?
